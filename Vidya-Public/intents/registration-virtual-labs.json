            "Virtual Labs are divided into two categories: simulation based labs and remote triggered labs. Registration requirements are different for the two categories.\n\nSimulation based Labs: All labs can be directly accessed by following the lab links on the web page.\n\nRemote Triggered Labs: To access a remote triggered lab, a user has to book a slot. For booking a slot, you have to register yourself first and then book a slot from the slot chart. All the available /booked slots can be viewed on this chart. Once a request for slot-booking is made, all the information regarding the user id, password and the slot booked will be sent to the userâ€™s email address provided by the user at the time of registration. Once registered, a user can login using the same credentials every time. This registration has to be done by the user separately for each of the remote triggered virtual labs."
