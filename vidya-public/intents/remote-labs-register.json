Once a request for slot-booking is made, all the information regarding the user id, password and the slot booked will be sent to the userâ€™s email address provided by the user at the time of registration. Once registered, a user can login using the same credentials every time. This registration has to be done by the user separately for each of the remote triggered virtual labs."
