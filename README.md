# Vidya ( Virtual Assistant )

Vidya is a Dialogflow based conversational chatbot, designed to streamline the interaction between people and virtual labs services. Vidya enhances user experience through dynamic & efficient simulated chat experience. 

Vidya is tightly integrated with the analytics [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tJI8OIV2F3BXFkniSODtyr3smj3SS2zQGc5Q-x5N8kI/edit?usp=sharing), answering a range of analytics & metrics related questions. 

Vidya consists of both public and private agents. The public bot deployed on [Vlead website](https://vlead.vlabs.ac.in) is trained to answer questions about labs, disciplines, FAQs, workshops, users/views trends, etc. The private bot deployed as part of Slack apps can answer questions related to Dialogflow bot training, agents structure & other private stuff. The public bot is a subset of the private bot, so the slack bot can also answer any of the public questions.

## Development

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/virtual-labs/virtual-labs-vidya/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details regarding development of bot

## Future Suggestions

* Building a chatbot is an iterative process, ideally bot admins should periodically check the bot status and update intents accordingly. The existing intents & documentation will be helpful in further bot improvements.
* Bot could handle questions about experiment availability  (eg. Is there a linked list lab?)
